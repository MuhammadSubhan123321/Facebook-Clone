📌 Project Description

This project is a frontend practice layout where I experimented with different UI elements like scrollbars, headers, action buttons (like, comment, share), and hover effects.

The main goal was to build a Facebook-like content box with icons, counters, and sidebars — all designed using pure HTML & CSS (no frameworks).

🎯 What I Learned

How to use CSS positioning effectively (absolute and relative instead of fixed) to control element placement.

Creating a custom right sidebar with a scroll effect.

Designing hover effects for buttons, scrollbars, and text (underline, color change, etc.).

Dividing action buttons equally with spacing using flexbox.

How different layout strategies can conflict or overlap, and how to debug them step by step.

⚡ Tech Used

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for styling (focus on positioning, hover, scrollbars, flexbox)
